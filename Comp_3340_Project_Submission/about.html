      <h2>Our Founder</h2>
      <p>My name is Adrianno Fallone.  I have 5+ years of experience in the fitness industry, and know what it takes to reach your goals.  When my 
                        clients mentioned that they wanted a one-stop-shop for all of their supplement needs,
                        Fall-1-Factor was born.</p>
      </p>

                  <p>Unlike other supplement retailers, we focus on you and all aspects of your journey. We do not solely offer workout-specific supplements.  
                        We also offer a collection of general purpose health supplements for any customer.  What's more is that our site offers
                        additional features not traditional of other retailers, including our built in macro-calculator and exercise-selection-tool.</p>
